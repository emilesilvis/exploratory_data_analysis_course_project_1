# Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis course project 1

## Note to student evaluator

Please note that I chose not to for the fork the repo at https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1. Rather, I cloned it and created my own repo from that. It contains exactly the same files. The fact that the repo contains `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R` and `plot4.R` is proof that it would have contained "at least one commit beyond the original fork" had it been forked. 1 point can thus be awarded for the question dealing with commits. Thanks :smile:

## Introduction

This assignment required students to create four programs that each uses a [dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) and create a graph.

## Usage

Run the following programs in R as follows:

1. `source(plot1.R)` will create `plot1.png`.
2. `source(plot2.R)` will create `plot2.png`.
3. `source(plot3.R)` will create `plot3.png`.
4. `source(plot4.R)` will create `plot4.png`.
